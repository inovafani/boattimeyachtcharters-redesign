/**
 * Permanent redirects from the old WordPress site.
 *
 * The redesign changed nearly every URL. Google still has the old ones indexed
 * and they were all returning 404, throwing away years of accumulated ranking —
 * most damagingly for the two vessels, which are the business's main named
 * entities. Every source below was confirmed to exist on the old site (via the
 * Wayback Machine's URL index) and to 404 today.
 *
 * Sources are written without a trailing slash: Next normalises `/foo/` to
 * `/foo` first, so both spellings land here.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT redirected: drafts and internal pages that should stay 404
 * (`/auto-draft`, `/home-btyc`, `/homelink`, `/sunsets-whale-draft`,
 * `/boattime-yc-runsheet`, `/1813-2`, `/thank-you`). Redirecting junk would
 * only invite Google to keep crawling it.
